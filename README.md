    ANALYSES 
         PRIMARY
         1.  Multi-level (mixed effects) left censored regression
         2.  Estimates used to derive adjusted MME and DME to assess whether difference in total mean pre-to-post intervention average daily MME or DME differed between study arms 

         SECONDARY
         1. Rxs => 50 MME
         2. Rxs > 90 MME
         3. New patients who received an opioid Rx

     
         POST-HOC
         1. Equality of coefficients testing whether study start coefficient (weeks 4-22) differed from study end (weeks 23-52)
         2. Three-way interaction tesing whether letter effect post-intervention was stronger for prescribers who had muliple decedents and received multiple comparator letters
